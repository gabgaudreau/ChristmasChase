# ChristmasChase
Game I created by myself, in the spirit of the holidays, during winter break of Dec 2016 and Jan 2017.

I own all of this content, apart from assets used from the asset store.

# TODO: 

* Sounds
* Trim project, removed unused files.

# To Play

* Game files and executables are too big for GitHub's recommended file size.
* The game is available for download here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-AEo0P82-wUTVdkV2ZHRTlqb2M/view?usp=sharing
